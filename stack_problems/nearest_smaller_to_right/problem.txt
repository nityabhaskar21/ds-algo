Given an array, print the Next Smaller to Right Element (NSR) for every element. 
The Next smaller Element to right for an element x is the first smaller element 
on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no smaller element exist, 
consider next greater element as -1.

Example:
Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
Output:        4      –>   2
               5      –>   2
               2      –>  -1
               25     –>  -1


Input: arr[] = [ 13 , 7, 6 , 3 ]
Output:         13      –>     7
                7       –>     6
                6       –>     3
                3       –>    -1
