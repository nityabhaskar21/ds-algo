Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. 
The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element 
on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, 
consider next greater element as -1.

Example:
Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
Output:        4      –>    5
               5      –>   25
               2      –>   25
               25     –>   -1
Explanation: except 25 every element has an element greater than them present on the right side

Input: arr[] = [ 13 , 7, 6 , 12 ]
Output:         13      –>     -1
                7       –>     12
                6       –>     12
                12      –>     -1
Explanation: 13 and 12 don’t have any element greater than them present on the right side
