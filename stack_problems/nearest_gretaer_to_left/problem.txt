Given an array, print the Next Greater to Left Element (NGL) for every element. 
The Next greater Element to left for an element x is the first greater element 
on the left side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, 
consider next greater element as -1.

Example:
Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
Output:        4      –>   -1
               5      –>   -1
               2      –>   5
               25     –>   -1


Input: arr[] = [ 13 , 7, 6 , 12 ]
Output:         13      –>     -1
                7       –>     13
                6       –>     7
                12      –>     13
