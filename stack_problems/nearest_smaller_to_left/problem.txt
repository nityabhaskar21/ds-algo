Given an array, print the Next Smaller to Left Element (NSL) for every element. 
The Next smaller Element to left for an element x is the first smaller element 
on the left side of x in array. Elements for which no smaller element exist, 
consider next greater element as -1.

Example:
Input: arr[] = [ 4 , 5 , 2 , 25 ]
Output:        4      –>   -1
               5      –>   4
               2      –>   -1
               25     –>   2


Input: arr[] = [ 13 , 7, 6 , 12 ]
Output:         13      –>     -1
                7       –>     -1
                6       –>     -1
                12      –>     6
