Manacher's algorithm is used to find the longest palindromic substring in any string. 
It is required to solve sub-problems of some very hard problems. 
The problem statement it solves is: Given a string 's' with the length of 'n'. 
Find the longest palindromic substring in the given string. 
A string is a palindrome when it is equal to the reverse of itself.

Complexity of Manacher's algorithm
Time complexity - O(N).


Brute Force Approach
The brute force / naive approach is slower than Manacher's algorithm, 
but it is a good stepping stone for understanding the problem and Manacher's algorithm. 
The Brute force approach is to check each substring of the given string 
whether the substring is a palindrome or not.

To implement the brute force approach, first, we will use a nested loop to get each substring, 
and then nest another loop to check whether that substring is a palindrome or not.
