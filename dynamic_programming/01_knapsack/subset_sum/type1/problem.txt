Given an array of non-negative integers and an integer sum. 
We have to tell whether there exists any subset in an array whose sum is equal to the given integer sum.

Examples:

Input:  sum = 7,  n = 6,  arr[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 3, 2}
Output: True
Explanation: There is a subset (4, 3) with sum 7.

Input:  sum = 10,  n = 6, arr[] = {2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2}
Output: True
