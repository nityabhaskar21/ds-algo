A graph G=(V, E) is called a bipartite graph 
if its vertices V can be partitioned into two subsets V1 and V2 
such that each edge of G connects a vertex of V1 to a vertex V2. 

It is denoted by Kmn, where m and n are the numbers of vertices in V1 and V2 respectively.

- We can divide all vertices of graph G into two subsets V1 and V2
- such that all edges of graph are from V1 to V2 and vice-versa.
- also called two coloring problem
