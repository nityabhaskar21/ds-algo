MST:- Given a connected, undirected and weighted graph G, select a subset of edges E, 
      such that graph G is connected to and total weight of connected edges E is minimum.    
    - Popular algorithms:-
        - Prim's algorithm
        - Kruskal's algorithm

    - Prim's algorithm uses greedy algorithm and priority_queue

    - Kruskal's algorithm uses greedy algorithm, 
        stores graph as edge list. DSU for detecting cycle and O(ElogV) complexity.
