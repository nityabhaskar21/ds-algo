MST:- Given a connected, undirected and weighted graph G, select a subset of edges E, 
      such that graph G is connected to and total weight of connected edges E is minimum.    

    - The standard application is to a problem like phone network design. 
    You have a business with several offices; 
    you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other, 
    and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. 
    You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. 
    It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isnâ€™t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money. 

    - Building roads for villages in minimum cost.



    - Popular algorithms:-
        - Prim's algorithm
        - Kruskal's algorithm

    - Prim's algorithm uses greedy algorithm and priority_queue

    - Kruskal's algorithm uses greedy algorithm, 
        stores graph as edge list. DSU for detecting cycle and O(ElogV) complexity.
