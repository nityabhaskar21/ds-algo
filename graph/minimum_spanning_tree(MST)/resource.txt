MST:- Given a connected, undirected and weighted graph G, select a subset of edges E, 
      such that graph G is connected to and total weight of connected edges E is minimum.    

    - The standard application is to a problem like phone network design. 
    You have a business with several offices; 
    you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other, 
    and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. 
    You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. 
    It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isnâ€™t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money. 

    - Building roads for villages in minimum cost.

    If there are V nodes, then there are V-1 edges in MST.

    - Popular algorithms:-
        - Prim's algorithm
        - Kruskal's algorithm

Prim's algorithm :-
    -Weighted undirected Graph
    -greedy algorithm
    -priority_queue

    Terms:-
    -MST set = []
    -Active Edge = edge from a vertex in MST set to V.
    -MST Edge = an edge that has been included in MST so far.

    Algorithm:
    1. Start from any source vertex say X.
    2. Out of all active edgeg, pick the one with smallest weight say X to Y.
        - select in Y in MST
        - add edges starting form Y in the active edge list.
    3. Repeat the 2nd step till MST is complete.
        

Kruskal's algorithm uses greedy algorithm, 
    stores graph as edge list. DSU for detecting cycle and O(ElogV) complexity.
