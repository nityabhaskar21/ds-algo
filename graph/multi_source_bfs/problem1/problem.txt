There is a rectangular grid of size n*m.
Each cll is either black(0) or white(1).
But atleast one is white.
Distance between two cells is equal to Manhattan distance between them.
For each cell, find out distance to the nearest white cell.

Manhattan distance (P1, P2) = |X1 - X2| + |Y1 - Y2|
    where P1 = (X1, Y1) and P2 = (X2, Y2)
