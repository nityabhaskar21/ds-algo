0. std::deque is an indexed sequence container.
1. It allows fast insertion at both beginning and end.
2. Unlike vector elements of deque are not stored contiguous.
3. it uses individual allocated fixed size array, with additional bookkeeping, 
    meaning index based access to deque
    must perform two pointer dereference, but in vector we get in one dereference.
4. The storage of a deque is automatically expanded and contracted as needed.
5. Expansion of deque is cheaper than expansion of vector.
6. A deque holding just one element has to allocate its full internal array (e.g. 8 times the object size on 
   64-bit libstdc++; 16 times the object size or 4096 bytes, whichever is larger, on 64-bit libc++).

TIME COMPLEXITY:
Random access - constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant O(1)
Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n)
